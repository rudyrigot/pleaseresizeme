ABOUT THE TALK
----------------

The 4-minute conference Lightning Talk was initially given in French by Rudy
Rigot, in a set of 10 lightning talks delivered at Paris Web 2011, on October
13th that year.

The supporting website was made by Rudy Rigot and Sophie Taboni, who were both
working for the web agency Clever Garden (subset of Clever Age) at the time.

There's a video of the whole [lightning talks session](http://www.paris-web.fr/2011/conferences/lightning-talks.php),
this very one being at the 16th minute.

ABOUT THE SITE
----------------

Subsequently to the talk, there was the website, [PleaseResize.me](http://pleaseresize.me),
to have the fun and the message stick in time.

OTHER TALKS
----------------

The talk was requested for a W3C Meetup in Lyon, France (in English, however),
on October 29th 2012.
